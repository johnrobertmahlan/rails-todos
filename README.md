# Simple Rails Todos App

When I was a student at General Assembly, we focused on languages like Javascript and Python and associated web app frameworks like NodeJS and Django. We never learned Ruby or Ruby on Rails. 

I decided to teach myself Rails by developing some simple apps. This app is a simple todos app that allows users to read, create, update, or delete tasks. I added some modals just to spice things up a bit.

Initially, the plan was to build the app by following this tutorial: https://iridakos.com/programming/2013/12/07/creating-a-simple-todo-part-1. But at a certain point, I decided to forge ahead on my own. That's why the datepicker doesn't work, for example.
